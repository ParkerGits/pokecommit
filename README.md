# pokecommit 🐢

Catch a Pokemon with each commit! 😸

```bash
go install github.com/ParkerGits/pokecommit
```

When you're ready to commit:

```
git add .
pokecommit -m "My pokecommit"
```

See more commands and flags with the help flag:

```
pokecommit -h
```

A database is created at `$HOME/pokecommit`. If you are tired of catching Pokemon, or you would like to reset your progress, you may delete this directory.
